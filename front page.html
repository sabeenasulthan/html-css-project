            <h1>About us</h1>
            <P>Perfume is a sophisticated mixture of fragrant essential oils, fixatives, and solvents (usually alcohol and water) designed to emit a pleasant, lasting scent. Used since ancient civilizations, modern perfumery blends natural ingredients—like flowers, spices, and woods—with synthetic compounds to create complex, artistic fragrances. Scent intensity varies by concentration, ranging from high-potency parfum (15–30%) to lighter eau de toilette (5–15%). When applied to pulse points like the wrists or neck, body heat slowly releases the scent, making it a powerful tool for personal expression, memory, and grooming.
